# GANFingerprint Deepfake Detection

A deep learning model for detecting GAN-generated deepfake images by analyzing subtle fingerprint patterns in both spatial and frequency domains.

## What are GAN Fingerprints?

GAN Fingerprints are distinctive patterns or traces that are unintentionally embedded in images generated by Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). These GAN fingerprints are akin to real human fingerprints, with the comparison that humans unintentionally leave fingerprints on the items they touch, that can be used to trace their identities. Just like human fingerprints, these GAN Fingerprints are unique to the GAN architecture the images are generated from, due to these factors:
1.	 Each GAN architecture has its own unique way of generating images based on its specific design, loss functions, and optimization methods. 
2.	Even GANs with identical architectures but different training datasets, random initializations, or hyperparameters will produce images with subtly different characteristics. 

## Objective of the project

With GAN image generation images getting more advanced, there may be difficulties identifying deepfake images through existing methods, such as detecting distortions in facial features and image details. Through our project, we hope to create a deepfake detection model that can identify deepfake images reliably, no matter how realistic the generated images are to the human eye. By customizing and creating a model that can discriminate deepfake images from real ones through their GAN Fingerprint profiles, we hope to come up with a more sophisticated model which can capture details invisible to the human eye. 

# Technical Overview of the Model

## Features

- Multi-path feature extraction from different network levels
- Frequency domain analysis to detect GAN fingerprint artifacts
- Self-attention mechanism for focusing on discriminative regions
- Highly reproducible results with deterministic implementation

## Model Architecture

The GANFingerprint model uses a multi-path feature extraction approach with specialized components:

- **Backbone**: ResNet34 separated into low, mid, and high-level feature extractors
- **Feature Fusion**: Combines spatial features from all levels with frequency domain analysis
- **Fingerprint Blocks**: Specialized layers with frequency awareness and spatial attention
- **Enhanced Classifier**: Multi-layer classifier with residual connections

## Dataset Preparation

Prepare your dataset with the following structure:
```
data/
├── train/
│   ├── real/   # Real images
│   └── fake/   # Fake/deepfake images
├── validation/
│   ├── real/
│   └── fake/
└── test/
    ├── real/
    └── fake/
```

## Configuration

Review and update `config.py` to match your environment:

```python
# Key parameters to check
DATA_ROOT = "data"  # Path to your dataset directory
INPUT_SIZE = 256    # Input image size
BACKBONE = "resnet34"  # Feature extractor backbone
BATCH_SIZE = 64     # Adjust based on your GPU memory
NUM_WORKERS = 4     # Number of data loading workers
LEARNING_RATE = 3e-4
NUM_EPOCHS = 30
DEVICE = "cuda"     # Use "cuda" for GPU, "cpu" for CPU
SEED = 42           # Random seed for reproducibility
```

## Usage

### Training

```bash
# Basic training with default parameters
python train.py

# With custom parameters
python train.py --data_root /path/to/data --batch_size 32 --lr 0.0003 --epochs 30 --backbone resnet34 

# Disable mixed precision (for older GPUs)
python train.py --no_amp

# Resume from a checkpoint
python train.py --resume_checkpoint checkpoints/[pth_file_name]
```

### Monitoring Training

```bash
# Start TensorBoard server
tensorboard --logdir logs
```

Then open your browser at http://localhost:6006 to monitor training progress.

### Evaluation

```bash
# Evaluate the model on the test set
python evaluate.py --checkpoint checkpoints/[pth_file_name] --output_dir eval_results
```

### Inference

```bash
# For a single image
python inference.py --checkpoint checkpoints/[pth_file_name] --input path/to/image.jpg --output inference_results

# For a directory of images
python inference.py --checkpoint checkpoints/[pth_file_name] --input path/to/images_dir --output inference_results --batch
```

## Reproducibility

The model is designed with reproducibility in mind:
- Fixed seeds for Python, NumPy, and PyTorch
- Deterministic operations in PyTorch
- Random state preservation in checkpoints
- Deterministic data loading

The dataset used to train the model is the 'deepfake and real images' dataset by Manjil Kariki.

Link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/manjilkarki/deepfake-and-real-images

This dataset provides a large dataset of real and deepfake images, split into train, test and validation sets, making it one of the best datasets to be used for deepfake classification models.

As long as you use the same dataset and compatible library versions, you should get consistent results across different runs.

## Troubleshooting

1. **CUDA Out of Memory**:
   - Reduce `BATCH_SIZE` in `config.py`
   - Try a lighter backbone (e.g., "resnet18")
   - Use smaller input image size

2. **Slow Training**:
   - Ensure you're using GPU acceleration
   - Increase `NUM_WORKERS` for faster data loading
   - Enable mixed precision with `USE_AMP = True`

3. **Library Compatibility Issues**:
   - If you encounter errors with newer PyTorch versions, try downgrading to 1.8.0-1.9.0
   - For any missing function errors, check the library documentation for version compatibility
